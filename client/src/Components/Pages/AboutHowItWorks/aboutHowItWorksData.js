      'Supply Change was founded in April 2018 by Aoise Keogan-Nooshabadi, Beth Pilgrim and Verena Wimmer after researching solutions to the gap in social enterprises in public sector supply chains.',
      'We found that despite many housing associations and other public organisations wanting to add social value to their supply chains, current procurement processes and portals made it hard for social enterprises to compete against larger private businesses. We decided to set up Supply Change to create a platform for social enterprises, housing associations and councils to find each other.',
      'Aoise, Verena and Beth are alumni of the Year Here programme, a post grad in social innovation that challenges fellows to find solutions to the UK’s toughest social issues. During the programme the team worked across frontline organisations such as housing associations, homeless hostels and schools and saw firsthand the benefits that social enterprises can deliver for different communities.'
