# Boilerplate for a server to serve up a create-react-app project

Notes:
  - 2 package.json's
    - 1 for the server and it's dependencies
    - 1 for the front end react stuff
  - If you're working on the FE you should `cd client` and work from there, doing your module installs from there so it goes to the correct package.json
  - If you're working from the BE you should work from this directory.
  - The server package.json has scripts to run the client stuff so you don't have to `cd` out of here every time.
